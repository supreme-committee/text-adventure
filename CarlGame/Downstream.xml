	<text>While the land remains more or less the same, this portion of the journey feels different to you. The settlements are farther apart, once you pass one which is no more than charred remains. After that you give any people you spot an even wider berth.

However, your party is still a days travel from your destination when trouble strikes again. The only warning you have is a high pitched whine. With a solid thud an arrow embeds itself in the side of the wagon, inches from your shoulder. </text>
