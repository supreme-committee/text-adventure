	<text>The next day passes much as the first, long stretches of countryside fall away behind you. Ursala is good company, when you aren't admiring the lands natural beauty you ask her endless questions about her homeland, constantly amazed by the ways of these foreigners. Several days pass this way without disturbance, the road is mostly devoid of company, it is not uncommon to walk the whole day without passing another person. As you move farther south the hills grow in scale. The journey so far has been more of a vacation than a job, so perhaps it is inevitable your good fortune will desert you.</text>
