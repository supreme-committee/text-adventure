Team Name: Supreme Committee

	 Our project is to make an interactive story game engine in C++.

A note on the makefile:
	Feel free to make your own targets. I have my own (debug-mgrijalva & release-mgrijalva) set up for my machine.
	
	There is also one for Mac machines. It possibly works in unix, not sure how sfml is installed on those systems
	If they are the same as Mac, it should work.
