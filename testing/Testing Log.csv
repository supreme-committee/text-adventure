Test Area,Description,Status
Command Line,,
,Run engine with no arguments,good
,Give engine invalid path to .tar file,"good, but save & load enable anyways(fixed)"
,Arguments out of order,good
,"No tar, only ""-l""",good
,Give it a non-tar file,Closes immediately with no error
Input tar files,,
,Give it a tar with no start.xml file,good
,A tar with random (non-xml files),good
Parser,,
12,Empty xml file,Crash (fixed)
13,xml file with only <tile> tags,good
14,xml with everything except <tile> tags,"no crash, but blank screen with no error message"
15,"Complete xml, but missing </tile> tag","good, but saving is enabled (not good)"
<if> statements,,
17,Less than 3 args,"Good, but we should change error message (""not enough stuff in if statement"")"
18,More than 3 args,"good, but wrong error message displated (""not enough stuff in if statement"")"
,Comparing 2 different variable types:,
20,           int vs bool,int then bool: no error message. bool then int: good
21,int vs string,int then string: no error message. string then int: no error message
22,bool vs string,bool then string: good. string then bool: no error message
23,Giving it a variable that doesn't exist,good
24,"Invalid comparisons (e.g. ""ee"" or ""jasd"")","Error always the same (""Invalid comparison used for bool variables"") (fixed)"
25,"Invalid comparison for variable type (compare int w/ bool w/ ""gt"" or ""ge"")",
36,"int comparisons (eq, gt, ge, lt, le, neq)",good
37,bool comparisons (eq),good
38,string comparisons (eq),good
Setting Variables,,
27,Variable names and values with spaces in them,good
28,<modify> properly changes ints by requested amount,good
29,"Calling <modify> on an int with invalid increment (i.e. ""--34"" or ""woot"")",Engine attempts to add the value anyways
30,Calling <modify> with value out of range of the int type,variable runs out of range. No crash.
31,Using invalid (e.g. <text>) tags within <modify> tags,No error message shown (fixed)
32,Make sure redefining a variable replaces its value,good
,Try to redefine variable as different type:,
33,Improperly redefine an int,good
34,Improperly redefine a bool,good
35,Improperly redefine a string,? Technically anything within <value> is valid once a string-var is defined
Saving and Loading,,
,Make sure related tar is saved with sav file,
,Ensure correct variables are restored when loading,
,Ensure engine denies sav when loaded for incorrect game,
Windows functionality,,
,Saving dialog works,
,Loading save game works,
,Loading new game works,
GUI,,
,Buttons expand properly with text,
,Text scrolling and fading functions correctly,
,Images are scaled correctly,
,Sounds are played correctly,
,Music is played correctly,
,"""Right-click to show picture"" feature works correctly",
