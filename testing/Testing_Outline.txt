=== Test cases ===

* Command line:
    - Run engine with no arguments
    - Run engine with invalid path to .tar file
    - arguments out of order (-l comes first)
    - No tar, only -l
    - Giving it a non-tar file

* Input files:
    - Pass it a .tar with no start.xml file inside
    - A tar with random (non-xml files)
    
* Files to pass to the parser:
    - Empty xml file
    - xml with only <tile> tags
    - xml with everything except <tile> tags
    - complete xml, but missing </tile> tag at end
    - If statements:
        - Less than 3 args (e.g. <if arg1="name" arg2="mike"></if>
        - More than 3 args
        - Comparing two different variable types
        - Giving it a variable that does not exist
        - Invalid comparisons (e.g. "ee" or "jsdkj")
        - Invalid comparison for variable type (compare int with string)
    
* Setting variables:
    - Variable names with spaces in them
    - Calling <modify> on an int with an invalid increment (i.e. "--343984" or "woot")
    - Calling <modify> with value out of range (i.e. 21474836470)
    - Redefining variables replaces their value.
    
* Window functionality
    - Saving
        - Crashes when cancel is clicked (fixed)
    - Loading saved game
    - Loading new game

* GUI
    - Buttons expand properly with text
    - Text scrolling and fading
    - Images are displayed correctly
    - Sounds are played correctly
    - Right-clicking works correctly (right-click hides everything)
