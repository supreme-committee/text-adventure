\section{Introduction}

In this section of the manual we will be going over how to play this very simple game after the .xml files have been made. Our game engine will take the files and set up the game to your specifications. 

\section{Basics}

As we start the game, a window will appear that has the text on the upper half of the screen. On the bottom half of the screen there will be boxes that contain the actions that are in that tile. To navigate the actions you can use either the mouse or the arrow keys.

There is a menu that pops up when the mouse is near the top of the window. On the menu bar we put three options that will let the player start a new game, save the game, or load a game.
