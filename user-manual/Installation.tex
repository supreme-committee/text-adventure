\section{Introduction}

Hello, in this section of the user manual we will be walking you through the really simple step of installing our game engine to your computer. Our installation will be easy and quick, you will be playing your text based game in minutes.

\section{Basics}

To start you should be aware that the game engine currently works on Mac and Windows. Each OS has a different method of installation. There will be a different section for each of the OS we are currently running.

\section{Windows}

For windows our programmer has made the installation process very easy. All you need to do is zip all your files, such as the tar.exe, sfml dll's.....(as we get more). The process should only be an "extract and run" kind of operation.
